SOME ANALYSIS OF THE ALGORITHM:



HOW TO CURVES:

Maybe put some fake intersections along the curve, which can form connections to endpoints  of the curve, but not be used themselves as endpoints:
It seems like it would clutter up the connections, matching extraneous stuff


Maybe store the pixels themselves, and walk along each path together
cv::matchShapes or Hausdorff distance (gets similarity between the connections' paths)

> But what about intersections along the path?
If they are present in one but not the other, they won't match anything, bringing down the whole character's score.
Maybe implement a "passthrough score" where intersections that are included in connections between other, strong intersections, have their significance lowered
