SOME ANALYSIS OF THE ALGORITHM:



HOW TO CURVES:

Maybe make sure skeletonization always draws teeth

Maybe put some fake intersections along the curve, which can form connections to endpoints  of the curve, but not be used themselves as endpoints:
It seems like it would clutter up the connections, matching extraneous stuff

Maybe just split long curves up: Walk along connection. If you've walked significantly longer than the distance from start, go back and put an intersection at the point that minimizes total discrepancy. 


Maybe store the pixels themselves, and walk along each path together
cv::matchShapes or Hausdorff distance (gets similarity between the connections' paths)

> But what about intersections along the path?
If they are present in one but not the other, they won't match anything, bringing down the whole character's score.
Maybe implement a "passthrough score" where intersections that are included in connections between other, strong intersections, have their significance lowered

> What about the whole "connections must be straight" thing
